# Duda Client / DudaC

When dealing with different software components to build a specific solution, it's important to have tools to setup a proper development environment which takes care of validate the system requirements and dependencies. Reducing entry complexity it's a must when working with frameworks for the first time, so the focus can stay on development and not in setup tasks.

Duda Client Manager (aka DudaC), is a tool made in Python with the objective to create a working development environment for who wants to build scalable web services using [Duda I/O](http://duda.io). It takes care to download the stack dependencies from GIT repositories and create a stage directory with a compiled stack for further use when running the service.
