# About Duda I/O

[Duda I/O](http://duda.io) is a C framework to build _Fast and Scalable Web Services_. It primary goals are high performance, resources usage optimization, flexibility through a small core and a packaging system to load third party features on-demand.

In technical terms, [Duda I/O](http://duda.io) provides a complete stack that works on _non-blocking_ mode (event-driven) and callbacks for each kind of request operation to work with. The stack is build on top of [Monkey HTTP Server](http://monkey-project.com), so it inherit all optimizations made to take the most of the [Linux Kernel](http://kernel.org) and scale properly on any kind of system, including the ones for Enterprise Linux or Embedded Linux.

[Duda I/O](http://duda.io) is currently a production ready stack being in use by third parties implementing _Ads Services_, _NoSQL frontends_ and _Home Automation_ within others. It can be used on any field where performance and response times are critical.
